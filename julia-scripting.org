* Julia Scripting
** According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)][Wikipedia]]:
   Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language.
   While it is a general purpose language and can be used to write any application,
   many of its features are well-suited for high-performance numerical analysis
   and computational science.
** But julia is also a perfectly good, even excellent, scripting language.
*** Here is an implementation of the UNIX echo command as a julia script
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
#!/usr/bin/julia
if length(ARGS) == 0
  print("\n")
elseif ARGS[1] == "-n"
  print(join(ARGS[2:end], " ")
else
  print(join(ARGS, " "), "\n")
end
#+END_SRC

*** Make your script executable with
chmod +x scriptname
*** Now you can run the script from bash
